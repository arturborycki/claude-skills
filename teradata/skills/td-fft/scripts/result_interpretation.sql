/*
FFT RESULT INTERPRETATION GUIDE:

1. MAGNITUDE SPECTRUM:
   - Shows amplitude of each frequency component
   - Peaks indicate dominant frequencies
   - Use for identifying periodic patterns

2. PHASE SPECTRUM:
   - Shows phase relationship between components
   - Important for signal reconstruction
   - Use for time-delay analysis

3. POWER SPECTRUM:
   - Shows energy distribution across frequencies
   - Measured in dB (decibels)
   - Use for comparing signal strength

4. SPECTRAL CENTROID:
   - "Center of mass" of frequency content
   - Higher values = more high-frequency content
   - Use for signal classification

5. SPECTRAL FLATNESS:
   - 0 to 1 scale (0=tonal, 1=noisy)
   - Indicates signal vs noise characteristics
   - Use for signal quality assessment

BUSINESS APPLICATIONS:
□ Vibration analysis: Identify mechanical issues from frequency patterns
□ Audio processing: Extract pitch, timbre, harmonics
□ Biomedical: Analyze EEG, ECG frequency content
□ Communications: Detect carrier frequencies, modulation
□ Quality control: Monitor process variations
□ Predictive maintenance: Detect anomalous vibrations
□ Sensor validation: Verify sensor response characteristics

NEXT STEPS:
□ Export results for visualization
□ Compare with baseline/historical data
□ Identify actionable insights
□ Document findings for stakeholders
□ Set up automated monitoring if needed
