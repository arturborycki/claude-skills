-- UAF Time Series Table Analysis Script
-- This script analyzes time series data structure for UAF processing

-- Step 1: Time Series Structure Discovery
SELECT
    ColumnName,
    ColumnType,
    Nullable,
    CASE
        WHEN ColumnType IN ('DATE', 'TIME', 'TIMESTAMP')
        THEN 'TEMPORAL'
        WHEN ColumnType IN ('INTEGER', 'BIGINT', 'DECIMAL', 'NUMERIC', 'FLOAT', 'DOUBLE PRECISION')
        THEN 'NUMERIC'
        WHEN ColumnType IN ('VARCHAR', 'CHAR', 'CLOB')
        THEN 'TEXT'
        ELSE 'OTHER'
    END as DataCategory
FROM DBC.ColumnsV
WHERE DatabaseName = '{USER_DATABASE}'
AND TableName = '{USER_TABLE}'
ORDER BY ColumnId;

-- Step 2: Time Series Data Profile
SELECT
    'Time Series Statistics' as AnalysisType,
    COUNT(*) as TotalRows,
    MIN({TIMESTAMP_COLUMN}) as MinTimestamp,
    MAX({TIMESTAMP_COLUMN}) as MaxTimestamp,
    COUNT(DISTINCT {TIMESTAMP_COLUMN}) as UniqueTimestamps,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as AnalysisTime
FROM {USER_DATABASE}.{USER_TABLE};

-- Step 3: Sampling Frequency Analysis
SELECT
    'Sampling Analysis' as MetricType,
    AVG(time_diff) as AvgInterval,
    STDDEV(time_diff) as StdDevInterval,
    MIN(time_diff) as MinInterval,
    MAX(time_diff) as MaxInterval
FROM (
    SELECT
        {TIMESTAMP_COLUMN},
        {TIMESTAMP_COLUMN} - LAG({TIMESTAMP_COLUMN})
        OVER (ORDER BY {TIMESTAMP_COLUMN}) as time_diff
    FROM {USER_DATABASE}.{USER_TABLE}
    QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY {TIMESTAMP_COLUMN}) > 1
) t;

-- Step 4: Value Column Statistics
SELECT
    '{VALUE_COLUMN}' as ColumnName,
    COUNT(*) as NonNullCount,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT({VALUE_COLUMN}) as NullCount,
    AVG(CAST({VALUE_COLUMN} AS FLOAT)) as MeanValue,
    STDDEV(CAST({VALUE_COLUMN} AS FLOAT)) as StdDev,
    MIN(CAST({VALUE_COLUMN} AS FLOAT)) as MinValue,
    MAX(CAST({VALUE_COLUMN} AS FLOAT)) as MaxValue
FROM {USER_DATABASE}.{USER_TABLE}
WHERE {VALUE_COLUMN} IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 5: UAF Array Preparation Check
SELECT
    'UAF Readiness' as CheckType,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT {TIMESTAMP_COLUMN}) = COUNT(*)
        THEN 'Regular Time Series - Ready for UAF'
        ELSE 'Irregular Time Series - May need preprocessing'
    END as Status,
    COUNT(*) as TotalObservations
FROM {USER_DATABASE}.{USER_TABLE};

/*
UAF-Specific Considerations:
1. Replace {USER_DATABASE} with actual database name
2. Replace {USER_TABLE} with actual table name
3. Replace {TIMESTAMP_COLUMN} with temporal column name
4. Replace {VALUE_COLUMN} with numeric value column name
5. Ensure regular sampling for optimal UAF performance
6. Consider time zone and temporal precision requirements
7. Validate array dimensions for 1D series or 2D matrices
